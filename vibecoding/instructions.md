Build a component that I can use in my react/vite app.

The component should have the following features:

- grid based excel editor
- Columns and rows like in excel
- possibility to edit texts
- possibility to edit numbers
- possibility to edit dates
- possibility to edit booleans

Use D3.js for the grid.
Needs to be very fast.

Tech stack:

- React / vite
- material ui
- D3.js as convas for the excelgrid.
- use typescript
- use pnpm as package manager
