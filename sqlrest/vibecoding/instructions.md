Create a C# asp.net core application that can be used to query a database and return the results as a json object.

Use FastEndpoints for the API.

Use Dapper for the database access.

The sql server database is running on 192.168.0.148:1433.  The database is called AdventureWorks2022.

The api should expose a REST CRUD API for the following tables:

- Person.Address
- Person.Person
- Person.StateProvince
- Production.Product
- Production.ProductCategory
- Production.ProductSubcategory
- Production.Location
- Production.BillOfMaterials
- Production.WorkOrder

The api should be dynamically generated by query sql server for the table schema.

The api should be able to handle pagination and sorting.

The api should be able to handle filtering.

The api should be able to handle complex queries.


The api should be able to handle errors, make sure it returns a proper error message.


Refactor the generated API. The GET should only support pagination.
Add an overall endpoint that exposes thelist of objects that can be selected.
